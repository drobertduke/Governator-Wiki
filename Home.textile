h1. What is Governator?

Governator is a library of extensions and utilities that extend "Google Guice":https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ to provide:

* Classpath scanning and automatic binding
* Lifecycle management
* Configuration to field mapping
* Asset/property loading
* Field validation
* Parallelized object warmup/cooldown

h1. Features

h3. Classpath scanning and automatic binding

Governator introduces a new annotation <code>AutoBindSingleton</code>. Governator will scan the Classpath to find classes annotated with AutoBindSingleton and bind them as Singletons.

h3. Lifecycle management

Governator adds support for the standard annotations: <code>PostConstruct</code> and <code>PreDestroy</code>.

h3. Configuration to field mapping

Governator introduces a new annotation <code>Configuration</code> that can be used to annotate class fields. Governator will assign the fields using configuration from property files, etc.

h3. Asset/property loading

Governator introduces a new annotation <code>RequiredAsset</code> that can be used to annotate classes. Governator will load the asset (e.g. a property file, etc.) when instances of the class are injected by Guice.

h3. Field validation

Governator supports the <code>javax.validation</code> annotations. Fields annotated with validation annotations will get validated by using the "Hibernate Validator":https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator
