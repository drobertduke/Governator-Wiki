_Yahhh â€“ PostConstruct me now unt PreDestroy me lay-tuh_

h2. What is Governator?

Governator is a library of extensions and utilities that extend "Google Guice":https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/ to provide:

* Classpath scanning and automatic binding
* Lifecycle management
* Configuration to field mapping
* Field validation
* Parallelized object warmup/cooldown

h2. Features

h3. Classpath scanning and automatic binding

Governator introduces the annotations <code>@AutoBindSingleton</code> and <code>@AutoBind</code>. See the [[Auto Binding]] wiki for details.

h3. Lifecycle management

Governator adds support for the standard annotations: <code>@PostConstruct</code> and <code>@PreDestroy</code>. See the [[Lifecycle Management]] wiki for details.

h3. Configuration to field mapping

Governator introduces a new annotation <code>@Configuration</code> that can be used to annotate class fields. Governator will assign the fields using configuration from property files, etc. Another annotation is also introduced, <code>@PreConfiguration</code>, for methods to be called prior to configuration assignment.

h3. Field validation

Governator supports the <code>javax.validation</code> annotations (JSR 303). Fields annotated with validation annotations will get validated via the "Hibernate Validator":https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator library.

h3. Parallelized object warmup/cooldown

Governator introduces two new annotations <code>WarmUp</code> and <code>CoolDown</code>. Methods annotated with <code>WarmUp</code> will get executed (in parallel) after injected by Guice. Methods annotated with <code>CoolDown</code> will get executed (in parallel) when the Governator Lifecycle is shut down.

h3. Lazy Singletons

Governator adds a LazySingleton annotation and scope. This is the opposite of Guice's Eager Singletons. Lazy singletons are not created until just before they are to be injected regardless of Guice's Stage.
 
h3. Generic Binding Annotations

The <code>com.netflix.governator.annotations.binding</code> package contains a set of generic binding annotations that you might find useful. These might be more clear and more maintainable to users than using Guice's <code>@Named</code>. The full set can be found here: "binding-annotations":https://github.com/Netflix/governator/tree/master/src/main/java/com/netflix/governator/annotations/binding

h2. Requirements/Prerequisites

It's assumed that you are familiar with Google Guice.

h2. Acknowledgements

Governator is based on ideas developed for the "Proofpoint Platform":https://github.com/proofpoint/platform library.

h2. Maven / Artifacts

Governator binaries are published to Maven Central.
