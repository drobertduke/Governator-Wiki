Classes annotated with @AutoBindSingleton@ will get auto-bound as Eager Singletons. This is useful for stand-alone classes such as cleanup tasks, etc. that aren't referred to in the code. E.g.

```java
@AutoBindSingleton
public class MyClass {
   ...
}
```

If MyClass is in a package specified via usingBasePackages(), Governator will automatically bind it as:


```java
binder.bind(MyClass.class).asEagerSingleton();
```
