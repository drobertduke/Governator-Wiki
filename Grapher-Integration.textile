Governator integrates the Guice Grapher that enables visualizing your injection hierarchy. See "here for more details":http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Grapher about Grapher.

To create the graph, either allocate or inject an instance of Governator's @Grapher@ class and then call one of its generation methods. E.g.

```java
@AutoBindSingleton
public class GraphFileCreator
{
    private final Grapher grapher;

    @Inject
    public GraphFileCreator(Grapher grapher)
    {
        this.grapher = grapher;
    }

    @PostConstruct
    public void createGraphFile() throws Exception
    {
        grapher.toFile(new File("mygraph.dot"));
    }
}
```

This will create a file named "mygraph.dot" in the working directory that can be viewed with "XDot":http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot.
