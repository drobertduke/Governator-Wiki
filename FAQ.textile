h3. Why is Governator needed?

Unlike other IoC containers, Guice does not handle: classpath scanning, lifecycle annotations, configuration/properties, validation, etc.

h3. Can I use this in Spring, PicoContainer, etc.?

With a small amount of work, Governator can be used with most DI frameworks. Details here: [[Spring, PicoContainer, Etc.]].
