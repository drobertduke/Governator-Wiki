h3. Why is Governator needed?

Unlike other IoC containers, Guice does not handle: classpath scanning, lifecycle annotations, configuration/properties, validation, etc.

h3. Aren't there other libraries that do this?

Yes. There are several Guice extensions that do some of these things. 

h3. Can I use this in Spring?

With a small amount of work, Governator can be used with Spring. Details here: [[Spring]].
