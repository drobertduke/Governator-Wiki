Guice users are familiar with the "binding phase" where Guice calls your modules to register bindings. You then create the Injector as a second phase. Governator introduces several new phases. The timeline is like this:

# Classpath scanning phase
** Specified packages are scanned for Governator annotations
** The classes are stored for later phases
# Bootstrapping phase
** The Application bootstrap module (if specified) is invoked
** Auto bind ConfigurationProviders are bound
** The LifecycleManager is created via the bootstrap Injector
# Main Injector phase
** Application provided modules are added
** AutoBindSingletons are bound as eager singletons
** AutoBind arguments are bound via the corresponding AutoBindProvider
** The main Injector is created
** As each object is created by Guice:
### PreConfiguration methods are called
### Configuration values are set
### PostConstruct methods are called
# Start phase
** The application calls LifecycleManager.start()
** Bean/field validation is done
** Any WarmUp methods are executed in background threads

---

When application calls LifecycleManager.close() ...

Each object that is being actively managed is shutdown in these steps:

# CoolDown methods are executed in background threads
# PreDestroy methods are called
