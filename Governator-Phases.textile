Guice users are familiar with the "binding phase" where Guice calls your modules to register bindings. You then create the Injector as a second phase. Governator introduces several new phases. The timeline is like this:

* Classpath scanning phase
** Specified packages are scanned for Governator annotations
** The classes are stored for later phases
* Bootstrapping phase
** Application bootstrap modules are invoked
** Auto bind AssetLoaders are bound
** The auto bind ConfigurationProvider (if one is found) is bound
** The LifecycleManager is created via the bootstrap Injector
* Main Injector phase
** Application provided modules are added
** AutoBindSingletons are bound
** Main Injector is created
** As each object is created by Guice:
### RequiredAssets are loaded
### Configuration values are set
### PostConstruct methods are called
* Start phase
** The application calls LifecycleManager.start()
** Bean/field validation is done
** Any WarmUp methods are executed in background threads
