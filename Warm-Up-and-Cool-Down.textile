In addition to the standard lifecycle annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy, Governator adds two new ones:

* @WarmUp
* @CoolDown

Methods annotated with @WarmUp will be called in a background executor when LifecycleManager.start() is called. Methods annotated with @CoolDown will be called in a background executor when LifecycleManager.close() is called. 

The number of threads in the executor is a factor of the number of cores available to the JVM.
