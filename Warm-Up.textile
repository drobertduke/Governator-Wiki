In addition to the standard lifecycle annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy, Governator adds: @WarmUp

Methods annotated with @WarmUp will be called in parallel (using the Java Fork-Join framework) when LifecycleManager.start() is called. Object dependencies are respected - i.e. if object A is dependent on objects B and C and all have warm up methods, object A's warm up method will not be executed until both objects B and C's warm up methods completes. Also, objects B and C's warm up methods will execute in parallel.

An alternate version of LifecycleManager.start() can be used to limit the amount of time allowed for warm up methods to complete.
