In addition to the standard lifecycle annotations @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy, Governator adds: @WarmUp

Methods annotated with @WarmUp will be called in a background executor when LifecycleManager.start() is called.

The number of threads in the executor is a factor of the number of cores available to the JVM.
