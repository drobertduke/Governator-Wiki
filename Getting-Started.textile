h2. Quick Start

Governator is mostly transparent. Use Guice as you normally would but with enhanced features. The major difference is that you now create the Injector through Governator. 

```java
Injector    injector = LifecycleInjector.builder()
    .withModules(yourModules).createInjector();
```

By creating your Injector this way @PostProcess annotations will be processed. 

h2. Just a Bit More

By adding two more lines of code a number of other Governator enhancements are enabled.

```java
LifecycleManager    manager = injector.getInstance(LifecycleManager.class);
manager.start();
```

Starting the Governator LifecycleManager causes field validation to be processed and the Governator @WarmUp methods to get executed.

When your application is shutting down, stop the LifecycleManager so that @CoolDown and @PreDestroy methods are executed.

```java
manager.close();
```
