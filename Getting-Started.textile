h2. Quick Start

Governator is mostly transparent. Use Guice as you normally would but with enhanced features. The major difference is that you now create the Injector through Governator. 

```java
Injector    injector = LifecycleInjector.builder()
    .withModules(yourModules).createInjector();
```

By creating your Injector this way @PostProcess annotations will be processed.
